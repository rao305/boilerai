## 📞 **Support & Troubleshooting**

### **Common Issues**

**"Service won't start"**
- Check Python virtual environment setup
- Verify port 5000 is available
- Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements_minimal.txt`

**"Web app can't connect"**
- Confirm bridge service running on port 5000
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify CORS settings

**"AI not responding intelligently"**
- Service may be in fallback mode (still works!)
- Check if OpenAI API key is configured
- Try simpler questions first

### **Debug Commands**
```bash
# Check service health
curl http://localhost:5000/health

# Test chat endpoint
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "test", "context": {"userId": "test"}}'

# Check Python imports
cd src/services/cliBridge && python -c "import main; print('OK')"
```
