## 🚀 API Endpoints

### Core Intelligence Endpoints
```bash
# Process transcript with AI analysis
POST /transcript/process
{
  "userId": "user123",
  "transcriptText": "STUDENT INFO\nName: John Doe...",
  "context": {}
}

# Set context feeding permission
POST /context/permission  
{
  "userId": "user123",
  "allowContextFeeding": true
}

}
```

### Enhanced Chat System
```bash
# Context-aware chat with permission handling
POST /chat
{
  "message": "Yes, use my data",  # Enables context
  "context": {"userId": "user123"}
}
```

## 🎭 User Experience Flow

### 1. **Transcript Upload**
User uploads transcript → System processes and stores context

### 2. **Permission Request**
```
🎓 "I noticed you recently analyzed your transcript!

I can provide much more personalized and intelligent academic guidance 
if you allow me to use your transcript data for context-aware recommendations.

This would help me:
• Give course recommendations based on your completed courses and grades
• Suggest optimal study strategies based on your academic performance  
• Provide personalized graduation planning based on your progress
• Offer track selection advice tailored to your strengths

Would you like me to use your transcript data for better personalized guidance?
Reply with:
- 'Yes, use my data' to enable intelligent context
- 'No thanks' to continue with general advice only"
```

### 3. **Intelligent Responses**
Once enabled, AI receives context like:
```json
{
  "student_info": {"name": "John Doe", "program": "Computer Science-BS"},
  "academic_standing": "Academic Notice", 
  "completed_courses": [
    {"code": "CS 18000", "grade": "F", "semester": "Fall", "year": 2024},
    {"code": "CS 18000", "grade": "C", "semester": "Spring", "year": 2025}
  ],
  "academic_progress": {
    "cumulative_gpa": 2.5,
    "struggling_courses": [{"code": "CS 18000", "grade": "F"}],
    "strong_performance": [{"code": "MA 16500", "grade": "B"}]
  }
}
```

### 4. **Personalized Recommendations**
AI provides specific advice like:
- "Based on your retake of CS 18000 improving from F to C, I recommend..."
- "Given your strong B in MA 16500, you're ready for MA 16600..."
- "Your current 2.5 GPA puts you on Academic Notice. Here's a recovery strategy..."

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Context Analysis Engine
```python
def analyze_transcript_for_context(transcript_data):
    """Extract key academic data for AI context"""
    - Student information extraction
    - Course performance analysis  
    - Academic progress calculations
    - Strength/weakness identification
    - Classification by course type
```

### Dynamic Context Injection
```python
def build_intelligent_context(user_id, message):
    """Build intelligent context based on user data and permissions"""
    - Check user permissions
    - Extract academic context
    - Build dynamic AI prompts
    - Integrate knowledge base data
```

### Permission Management
```python
def should_offer_context_permission(user_id):
    """Determine if user should be offered context feeding"""
    - Has transcript data: ✓
    - Permission not asked: ✓  
    - Not explicitly denied: ✓
    → Offer permission
```
