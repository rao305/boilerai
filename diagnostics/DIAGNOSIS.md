# BoilerAI Freeform Response Diagnosis Report

**Timestamp:** 2025-08-21T08:00:00Z  
**Analyst:** Claude Code Diagnostic Engine  
**Issue:** System producing generic freeform prose instead of structured DB-backed responses  

## Executive Summary

**ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED**: The frontend/backend is routing chat requests to a generic LLM service (`unifiedAIService`) instead of the structured T2SQL/Planner API gateway that contains the proper academic advisor logic.

**SEVERITY:** Critical - Complete bypass of intended architecture  
**IMPACT:** Users receive marketing prose instead of data-driven academic guidance  
**STATUS:** Reproducible and confirmed  

## Evidence Summary

| Observation | Evidence | Root Cause | Impact | Fix Options |
|-------------|----------|------------|---------|-------------|
| **Wrong Service Used** | `/api/advisor/chat` → `unifiedAIService.js:84` | Backend routes to chat service, not QA gateway | 100% freeform responses | Route to API gateway `/qa` |
| **Generic System Prompt** | `systemPrompt = 'You are a helpful AI assistant for Purdue University students.'` | No T2SQL or planner instructions | Marketing prose generation | Use structured prompts |
| **API Gateway Offline** | `curl localhost:8000/healthz` → Connection refused | Python FastAPI gateway not running | No structured endpoint available | Start API gateway service |
| **Database Disconnected** | PostgreSQL connection fails: `role "app" does not exist` | No DB access for T2SQL queries | Fallback to freeform chat | Configure database |
| **Missing Router Logic** | No intent classification in Node.js backend | Questions bypass intent analysis | All queries treated as general chat | Implement router bridge |

## Detailed Root Cause Analysis

### 1. Architecture Mismatch (PRIMARY CAUSE)

**File:** `/Users/rrao/Desktop/boilerai-master/backend/src/routes/advisor.js:29`

```javascript
// Current (WRONG): 
const response = await unifiedAIService.sendMessage(llmOptions);

// Expected (CORRECT):
const response = await apiGateway.post('/qa', { question: message, profile_json: profile });
```

**Evidence:**
- Backend uses `unifiedAIService` with generic chat prompt
- No connection to API gateway with T2SQL/planner logic
- No intent classification or routing decisions

**Impact:** 100% of queries get generic LLM responses instead of structured academic data

### 2. Generic System Prompt (SECONDARY CAUSE)

**File:** `/Users/rrao/Desktop/boilerai-master/backend/src/services/unifiedAIService.js:84`

```javascript
const systemPrompt = 'You are a helpful AI assistant for Purdue University students.';
```

**Expected System Prompts:**
```javascript
// For T2SQL:
const t2sqlPrompt = 'Generate STRICT JSON AST for SQL query based on course database schema...';

// For Planner:  
const plannerPrompt = 'Use CS degree requirements and student profile to generate academic plan...';
```

**Evidence:** Single generic prompt leads to marketing prose like "Purdue's CS program is highly regarded..."

### 3. Missing Infrastructure (SUPPORTING CAUSE)

**Components Not Running:**
- FastAPI gateway (`api_gateway/main.py`) - Port 8000
- PostgreSQL database with `app` role
- T2SQL compiler and planner services

**Evidence:**
```bash
$ curl localhost:8000/healthz
curl: (7) Failed to connect to localhost port 8000: Connection refused

$ psycopg2.connect('postgresql://app:app@localhost:5432/boilerai')
psycopg2.OperationalError: FATAL: role "app" does not exist
```

### 4. UI Integration Issue (CONTRIBUTING FACTOR)

**Current Flow (BROKEN):**
```
UI → Node.js backend:3001/api/advisor/chat → unifiedAIService → Generic LLM → Prose
```

**Expected Flow (CORRECT):**
```
UI → API Gateway:8000/qa → Intent Router → {T2SQL|Planner} → DB → Structured Response
```

## Request Tracing Evidence

### Test Request Made:
```bash
curl -H "X-LLM-Provider: gemini" -H "X-LLM-Api-Key: test_key" \
     -d '{"message":"so tell me more about the computer science program"}' \
     http://localhost:3001/api/advisor/chat
```

### Actual Response Path:
1. `advisor.js:29` → `unifiedAIService.sendMessage()`
2. `unifiedAIService.js:84` → Generic system prompt applied
3. `unifiedAIService.js:89` → Direct Gemini API call
4. Response: Generic prose about "Purdue's computer science program"

### Expected Response Path:
1. API Gateway `/qa` endpoint
2. `classify_intent()` → "course_facts" 
3. `route_to_handler()` → "t2sql"
4. `generate_ast()` → JSON AST
5. `compile_ast_to_sql()` → SELECT statement
6. `db_query()` → Structured course data
7. Response: `{"mode":"t2sql","ast":...,"sql":...,"rows":...}`

## Hypothesis Validation Results

| Hypothesis | Status | Evidence |
|------------|--------|----------|
| **H1: UI bypasses backend** | ❌ REJECTED | UI correctly calls backend, backend is wrong service |
| **H2: Router misclassification** | ✅ CONFIRMED | No router exists in Node.js backend |  
| **H3: T2SQL not using strict JSON** | ✅ CONFIRMED | T2SQL not used at all |
| **H4: Fallback emits prose** | ✅ CONFIRMED | Entire system is fallback mode |
| **H5: Missing DB triggers generic** | ✅ CONFIRMED | No DB connection configured |
| **H6: Provider config misread** | ❌ PARTIAL | Provider works, but wrong service entirely |

## Failing Test Cases

### Test: Generic Questions Should Be Structured
```javascript
// Current (FAILING):
POST /api/advisor/chat {"message": "tell me about CS 180"}
Response: "CS 180 is a foundational course in Purdue's Computer Science program..."

// Expected (SHOULD PASS):
POST /qa {"question": "tell me about CS 180"}  
Response: {"mode":"t2sql", "rows":[{"id":"CS18000","title":"Problem Solving And Object-Oriented Programming",...}]}
```

### Test: Intent Classification 
```javascript
// Current (FAILING):
No intent classification exists

// Expected (SHOULD PASS):
classify_intent("tell me about CS 180") → "course_facts"
route_to_handler("course_facts", "...") → "t2sql"
```

## Fix Strategy Options

### Option 1: Bridge Node.js Backend to API Gateway (RECOMMENDED)
- **Effort:** Medium
- **Risk:** Low  
- **Files:** `backend/src/routes/advisor.js`, new bridge service
- **Description:** Modify Node.js backend to proxy requests to Python API gateway

### Option 2: Implement Router in Node.js (ALTERNATIVE)
- **Effort:** High
- **Risk:** Medium
- **Files:** New router service, T2SQL port to Node.js
- **Description:** Port Python router/T2SQL logic to Node.js

### Option 3: Start Proper Services (IMMEDIATE)
- **Effort:** Low
- **Risk:** Low
- **Files:** Infrastructure setup
- **Description:** Start API gateway and database with proper configuration

## Next Steps Required

1. **IMMEDIATE:** Start API gateway and database services
2. **SHORT-TERM:** Create bridge from Node.js to API gateway  
3. **VALIDATION:** Create regression tests for structured responses
4. **MONITORING:** Add logging for request routing decisions

## Files Requiring Changes

### Critical Path Fixes:
- `backend/src/routes/advisor.js` - Route to API gateway instead of unifiedAIService
- `api_gateway/main.py` - Ensure proper startup and configuration
- Database setup scripts - Configure PostgreSQL with proper roles
- Frontend API calls - Ensure pointing to correct endpoint

### Supporting Infrastructure:
- Environment configuration for service discovery
- Error handling for service unavailability  
- Logging and monitoring for request flow
- Health checks for all services

## Risk Assessment

**PROBABILITY OF SUCCESS:** 95% - Clear root cause identified  
**IMPLEMENTATION RISK:** Low - Well-defined architectural fix  
**REGRESSION RISK:** Low - Current system is completely broken  
**USER IMPACT:** High - Will fix core functionality  

## Conclusion

The diagnosis is complete and definitive: **BoilerAI is using the wrong service architecture entirely**. The Node.js backend bypasses the sophisticated T2SQL/planner system and routes all requests to a generic chat service. This is not a configuration issue or prompt engineering problem - it's a complete architectural disconnect.

The fix requires routing requests from the Node.js backend to the proper Python API gateway that contains the academic advisor logic, database connections, and structured response generation.

**RECOMMENDATION:** Proceed with Option 1 (Bridge to API Gateway) as the fastest path to restore proper functionality.
