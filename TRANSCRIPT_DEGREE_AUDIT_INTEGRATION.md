- **Credits Analysis**: Tracks remaining credits needed (out of 128 total)
- **Semester Planning**: Estimates semesters remaining at current pace
- **Progress Tracking**: Shows completion percentage across all requirements
- **Academic Standing**: Determines current academic status based on GPA

### 4. ‚úÖ Real-Time Academic Progression
- **Year Level Determination**: Classifies as Freshman/Sophomore/Junior/Senior
- **GPA Monitoring**: Tracks both cumulative and major GPA
- **On-Track Analysis**: Determines if student is on pace for timely graduation
- **Warning System**: Alerts for academic probation risk, missing prerequisites

### 5. ‚úÖ Intelligent Recommendations
- **Personalized Warnings**: GPA issues, credit deficiencies, timeline concerns
- **Academic Guidance**: Specific recommendations for course planning
- **Prerequisite Checking**: Identifies missing prerequisites for advanced courses
- **Summer Course Suggestions**: Recommends acceleration options when behind

## üîß Technical Implementation
