How are minds related to brains, and to the physical bodies that they seem to animate and control? How do minds represent the world around them? What is a self? What is the nature of consciousness and subjective experience? Could other animals, aliens, computers, robots or other types of entities have minds, or be conscious? How would we know?

Will AI agents change the nature of work? Can they be used to regulate individuals and their opportunities through automated algorithms and sorting software? What are the human and environmental costs of a full-throated adoption of AI? This class will arm you with the philosophical and historical background to begin to devise and weigh the creative opportunities and challenges posed by this future. We'll first consider traditional questions and issues in the philosophy of computation, epistemology, ethics and justice before turning to home onto a series of specific challenges that may include issues of AI in equity, AI and the law, AI and gender, AI and labor, AI and policy, the future of AI, and whether we can even design 'ethical' AI.",philosophy_selective,Any,0,0,False,False,,cli_bot,,
