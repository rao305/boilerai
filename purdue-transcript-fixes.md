# Purdue Transcript Parsing - Fixed

## Problem Analysis
Based on your transcript images, I identified that the system was returning zeros because:

1. **Generic AI prompt** - The original prompt was too generic and didn't understand Purdue's specific transcript format
2. **Poor PDF text extraction** - Basic text extraction wasn't properly handling PDF format
3. **Wrong data structure expectations** - The AI wasn't trained to look for Purdue's specific table format and terminology

## Purdue Transcript Format Understanding

From your transcript images, I analyzed the exact structure:

### **Student Information Section**
- Name: "Rohit Vayugundla Rao"
- Student Type: "Continuing"
- Current Program: "Bachelor of Science"
- Program: "Computer Science-BS"
- College: "College of Science"
- Campus: "Indianapolis and W Lafayette"
- Major: "Computer Science"

### **Institution Credit Sections**
Organized by periods like:
- **Period: Fall 2024**
- **Period: Spring 2025**

Each period contains a table with columns:
- Subject | Course | Campus | Level | Title | Grade | Credit Hours | Quality Points | R

### **Course Examples From Your Transcript**
- CS | 18000 | Indianapolis and W Lafayette | UG | Prob Solving & O-O Programming | F | 4.000 | 0.00
- CS | 19300 | Indianapolis and W Lafayette | UG | Tools | B | 1.000 | 3.00
- MA | 16500 | Indianapolis and W Lafayette | UG | Analytc Geomtry&Calc I | B | 4.000 | 12.00

### **Course(s) in Progress Section**
Future planned courses:
- CS | 18200 | West Lafayette | UG | Foundations Of Comp Sc | 3.000
- CS | 25000 | Indianapolis and W Lafayette | UG | Computer Architecture | 4.000

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. **Specialized Purdue AI Prompt**
```
You are parsing a Purdue University transcript. These transcripts have a specific format with tables showing courses by semester period.

IMPORTANT: Look for these exact patterns:
1. STUDENT INFORMATION section with Name, Program, College, Campus
2. INSTITUTION CREDIT sections organized by "Period: [Semester] [Year]"
3. Course tables with columns: Subject | Course | Campus | Level | Title | Grade | Credit Hours | Quality Points
4. COURSE(S) IN PROGRESS section for future/planned courses
5. TRANSCRIPT TOTALS section with overall GPA

Parse ALL periods (Fall 2024, Spring 2025, Summer 2025, Fall 2025, etc.)
For course codes, combine Subject + Course (e.g., "CS" + "18000" = "CS 18000")
Extract ALL courses from completed periods AND in-progress periods.
```

### 2. **Enhanced PDF Text Extraction**
- **Better binary parsing** - Improved extraction of readable text from PDF bytes
- **Pattern validation** - Checks for Purdue-specific terms and course code patterns
- **Debugging output** - Shows what text was extracted for troubleshooting
- **Error handling** - Clear error messages if PDF extraction fails

### 3. **Accurate Example Data**
Updated all sample/fallback data to match your exact transcript format:
- Course codes: "CS 18000", "MA 16500" (not "CS 180", "MA 161")
- Titles: "Prob Solving & O-O Programming", "Analytc Geomtry&Calc I"
- Purdue-specific program format: "Computer Science-BS"
- Campus format: "Indianapolis and W Lafayette"

### 4. **Comprehensive Course Extraction**
- **Completed courses** - Extracts from all "Period: [Semester] [Year]" sections
- **In-progress courses** - Extracts from "COURSE(S) IN PROGRESS" section
- **All semesters** - Processes Fall 2024, Spring 2025, Summer 2025, Fall 2025, etc.
- **Accurate GPA** - Uses the actual GPA values from transcript totals

## Expected Results

Now when you upload your Purdue transcript, the system should:

✅ **Extract your actual student information** (name, program, college, campus)
✅ **Find all your completed courses** from Fall 2024, Spring 2025, etc.
✅ **Capture all planned courses** from Summer 2025, Fall 2025, etc.
✅ **Use correct course codes** like "CS 18000", "MA 16500"
✅ **Show accurate grades and credits** from your transcript
✅ **Calculate correct GPA** (2.88 in your case)
✅ **Include all semesters** (not just the first year)

## Test the Fix

1. **Upload your PDF transcript** again
2. **Check the console logs** - you should see detailed extraction and parsing information
3. **Verify the data** - the degree audit should now show your actual courses and grades
4. **Check course transfer** - courses should automatically appear in your academic planner

The system now understands Purdue's specific format and should capture all your actual transcript data instead of returning zeros!
