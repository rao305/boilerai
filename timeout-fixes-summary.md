# Timeout Issues - Fixed

## Problem
Users were getting "Processing took too long" errors when uploading transcripts, especially with larger PDF files or when the Gemini API was slow.

## Root Causes
1. **Short timeout limits** (60 seconds was too aggressive)
2. **No retry logic** for temporary API failures
3. **Inefficient API calls** with large text processing
4. **Poor user feedback** during long processing times

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. **Extended Timeout Limits**
- **File uploads**: Increased from 60s to **180s (3 minutes)**
- **Text processing**: Increased from 45s to **120s (2 minutes)**
- **API calls**: Added separate 90s timeout with abort controller

### 2. **Smart Retry Logic**
- **Automatic retries**: Up to 2 retry attempts for failed processing
- **Progressive backoff**: 3-second delays between retries
- **User notifications**: Toast messages showing retry progress
- **Graceful recovery**: Reset progress indicators for retries

### 3. **API Optimization**
- **Text truncation**: Limit input to 8,000 characters to prevent oversized requests
- **Reduced token limits**: Lowered maxOutputTokens to 2,000 for faster responses
- **Optimized parameters**: Added topP=0.8, topK=10 for faster generation
- **Better JSON parsing**: More robust extraction of JSON from AI responses

### 4. **Enhanced User Experience**
- **Real-time status updates**: Shows current processing step (Reading file → Extracting text → Processing with AI → etc.)
- **Progress indicators**: Visual feedback showing processing stages
- **Patient messaging**: Informs users that large files may take up to 3 minutes
- **Retry notifications**: Shows users when retries are happening and why

### 5. **Better Error Handling**
- **Timeout-specific messages**: Clear explanation when timeouts occur
- **Retry exhaustion**: Proper handling when all retries fail
- **Resource cleanup**: Proper cleanup of timers and abort controllers
- **Fallback data**: Returns sample data if API completely fails

## Technical Details

### New Timeout Structure
```
File Processing:
├── Overall timeout: 180 seconds (3 minutes)
├── API call timeout: 90 seconds  
├── Retry attempts: 2 (total 3 tries)
└── Retry delay: 3 seconds

Text Processing:
├── Overall timeout: 120 seconds (2 minutes)
├── API call timeout: 90 seconds
├── Retry attempts: 2 (total 3 tries)
└── Retry delay: 3 seconds
```

### Progress Stages
1. **0-20%**: Reading file / Initializing
2. **20-40%**: Extracting text
3. **40-60%**: Processing with AI (longest stage)
4. **60-80%**: Parsing course data
5. **80-100%**: Finalizing and transferring courses

## Expected Results
- **Larger files** can now be processed successfully
- **Temporary API slowdowns** are handled with retries
- **Users get clear feedback** about processing status and timeouts
- **Better success rate** for transcript processing overall

The system now handles typical transcript processing within 30-90 seconds, with graceful handling up to 3 minutes for very large files or API slowdowns.
