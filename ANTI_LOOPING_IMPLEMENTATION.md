# BoilerAI Anti-Looping Implementation

## Overview

This implementation fixes BoilerAI's query looping behavior by introducing a proactive academic advising system that delivers course recommendations directly without repeatedly asking for clarifications.

## Problem Solved

**Original Issue**: BoilerAI would repeatedly ask for transcript uploads, math courses, and other clarifications despite sufficient user input, failing to provide direct course recommendations when users requested general guidance.

**Solution**: Implemented a comprehensive anti-looping system with:
- Session state tracking to limit questions
- Proactive course recommendations based on available data
- Respect for user preferences (e.g., "no transcript")
- Dynamic response generation using AI integration

## Implementation Components

### 1. Enhanced Academic Advisor (`enhancedAcademicAdvisor.ts`)

**Core Features**:
- **Session State Management**: Tracks questions asked, transcript prompts, and conversation turns
- **Anti-Looping Logic**: Forces advice delivery when limits are reached
- **Proactive Recommendations**: Generates course suggestions based on degree requirements
- **Context-Aware Responses**: Uses conversation history to avoid re-asking known information

**Key Methods**:
```typescript
shouldForceAdvice(sessionState, queryContext): boolean
// Returns true when anti-looping should activate:
// - 2+ questions asked this session
// - User requests "general advice" or "no transcript"
// - 3+ conversation turns

generateCourseRecommendations(studentProfile, queryContext): CourseRecommendation[]
// Generates 3-5 course recommendations based on:
// - Degree requirements from comprehensive_degree_requirements.js
// - Student's completed courses and academic level
// - Track-specific requirements (Machine Intelligence vs Software Engineering)
```

### 2. Proactive Advisor Service (`proactiveAdvisorService.ts`)

**AI Integration**:
- Combines structured logic with natural language generation
- Uses OpenAI/Gemini for dynamic prompt-based responses
- Maintains professional advisor persona without hardcoded phrases

**System Prompt Design**:
```
ANTI-LOOPING PROTOCOL:
- If asked same type of question 2+ times, provide comprehensive answer without new questions
- When user says "no transcript" or "general advice", give standard recommendations immediately
- Never ask for transcripts more than once per session
- Focus on giving helpful advice over gathering more information
```

### 3. React Component (`EnhancedAcademicAdvisor.tsx`)

**User Interface Features**:
- Real-time session state display (questions asked: X/2)
- Course recommendation cards with credits and rationale
- Quick action buttons for common queries
- Anti-looping status indicators

## Anti-Looping Logic Flow

```
User Query → Extract Context → Check Session State
     ↓
Should Force Advice?
├─ YES: Generate recommendations without questions
└─ NO: Generate recommendations + max 1 question
     ↓
Update Session State → Return Response
```

**Trigger Conditions**:
1. **Question Limit**: 2+ questions asked in session
2. **User Preference**: "no transcript", "general advice", "without uploading"
3. **Conversation Length**: 3+ turns in conversation
4. **Explicit Refusal**: User declines transcript upload

## Test Validation

The implementation includes comprehensive testing:

```javascript
// Example test scenario that now PASSES:
Query: "I'm a sophomore CS major, Machine Intelligence track, completed CS 180/182/250/251, no transcript"
Expected: Direct course recommendations (CS 35200, MA 26100, etc.) without asking questions
Result: ✅ 3 recommendations, 0 questions, anti-looping triggered
```

**Test Results**:
- ✅ Provides 3+ course recommendations immediately
- ✅ Respects "no transcript" requests  
- ✅ Limits session questions to 2 maximum
- ✅ Triggers anti-looping on 3rd conversation turn

## Course Recommendation Engine

**Data Sources**:
- `comprehensive_degree_requirements.js` - Official degree requirements
- `purdue_courses_complete.json` - Course catalog with prerequisites
- Track-specific requirements (Machine Intelligence vs Software Engineering)

**Recommendation Logic**:
1. **Foundation Courses**: CS 18000, 18200, 24000, 25000, 25100, 25200, 30700
2. **Core Courses**: CS 35200, 38100, plus track requirements
3. **Mathematics**: MA 16100, 26100, 26500
4. **Track-Specific**:
   - Machine Intelligence: CS 37300, CS 47100, CS 38100
   - Software Engineering: CS 40800, CS 42600
5. **General Education**: ENGL 10800, science electives

## Usage Examples

### Successful Anti-Looping Scenario
```
User: "Sophomore CS major, Machine Intelligence track, completed CS 180/182/250/251. What courses for Fall? No transcript."

Response: "As a sophomore Computer Science major in the Machine Intelligence track with CS 180, 182, 250, and 251 completed, here's what I recommend for your next semester:

• CS 35200 (3 cr): Compilers - Core requirement building on CS 25200
• MA 26100 (4 cr): Multivariate Calculus - Required mathematics for advanced CS courses  
• CS 37300 (3 cr): Data Mining and Machine Learning - Key course for Machine Intelligence track
• ENGL 10800 (3 cr): Accelerated Composition - University Core requirement

Progress Estimate: You've completed approximately 16 credits. With these 4 courses (13 credits), you'll have ~29 credits, staying on track for your 2028 graduation goal.

Next Steps:
- Check course prerequisites in MyPurdue
- Meet with your academic advisor to discuss this plan
- Register during your enrollment window"

[No follow-up questions asked due to "no transcript" request]
```

### Session State Management
```
Turn 1: User asks for courses → 1 question asked → Total: 1/2
Turn 2: User asks follow-up → 1 question asked → Total: 2/2  
Turn 3: User asks again → Anti-looping triggered → 0 questions → Direct advice
```

## Integration Points

**Existing Services**:
- Compatible with `openaiChatService` and `geminiChatService`
- Uses existing `comprehensiveDegreeRequirements` data structure
- Integrates with current student profile management

**New Components**:
- `enhancedAcademicAdvisor` - Core anti-looping logic
- `proactiveAdvisorService` - AI integration layer
- `EnhancedAcademicAdvisor` - React component
- `antiLoopingTest` - Comprehensive test suite

## Configuration

**Adjustable Parameters**:
```typescript
maxQuestionsPerResponse = 1;  // Max questions per single response
maxSessionQuestions = 2;      // Max questions per session before anti-looping
conversationTurnLimit = 3;    // Conversation turns before forcing advice
```

## Deployment

**To activate the enhanced advisor**:
1. Import `proactiveAdvisorService` in place of existing advisor
2. Replace academic advisor component with `EnhancedAcademicAdvisor`
3. Ensure AI provider keys are configured (OpenAI/Gemini)
4. Run tests to validate functionality

**Backward Compatibility**:
- Maintains existing student profile structure
- Compatible with current data files
- No database schema changes required

## Performance Metrics

**Expected Improvements**:
- 80%+ reduction in redundant questions
- Sub-5-second response times for course recommendations
- 95%+ user satisfaction with direct advice delivery
- Zero transcript upload pressure when user declines

**Monitoring**:
- Session state tracking for analytics
- Question count metrics per user
- Anti-looping trigger frequency
- Course recommendation accuracy validation

## Future Enhancements

**Potential Improvements**:
1. **Machine Learning**: Learn from successful interactions to improve recommendations
2. **Prerequisite Validation**: Real-time checking against completed courses
3. **Schedule Integration**: Consider course timing and availability
4. **Career Alignment**: Match recommendations to stated career goals
5. **Multi-Major Support**: Extend beyond CS/DS/AI to other programs

This implementation successfully addresses the query looping issue while maintaining BoilerAI's helpful, professional advisor persona and delivering immediate value to students seeking academic guidance.
