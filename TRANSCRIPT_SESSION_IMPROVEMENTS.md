# Transcript Session Management Improvements

## Summary of Changes

I've implemented comprehensive improvements to the transcript parsing and academic planner integration to address session persistence and course override functionality.

## Key Improvements Made

### 1. **Session-Based Transcript Data Storage**
- **Before**: Transcript data was loaded but not consistently persisted across page navigation
- **After**: Transcript data automatically loads from localStorage on context initialization
- **Implementation**: Enhanced `AcademicPlanContext` to load transcript data on startup and auto-transfer courses

### 2. **Course Override Logic**
- **Before**: New transcript uploads would duplicate or conflict with existing courses
- **After**: New transcript uploads replace previously imported transcript courses while preserving manually added courses
- **Implementation**: Added `shouldOverride` parameter to `transferCoursesToPlanner()` that clears courses with `transferred_` prefix before adding new ones

### 3. **Academic Planner Persistence**
- **Before**: Academic planner data didn't consistently save across sessions
- **After**: All academic planner changes automatically save to localStorage
- **Implementation**: Added localStorage save operations to all course modification functions

### 4. **Enhanced User Experience**
- **Before**: No clear indication if transcript was loaded
- **After**: Page header shows student name when transcript is loaded, button changes to "Update Transcript"
- **Implementation**: Dynamic subtitle and button styling based on transcript data state

## Technical Implementation Details

### Context Changes
```typescript
// Auto-load transcript data on initialization
const [transcriptData, setTranscriptData] = useState<TranscriptData | null>(() => {
  // Loads from localStorage automatically
});

// Enhanced transfer function with override capability
const transferCoursesToPlanner = (selectedCourses: ParsedCourse[], shouldOverride: boolean = true) => {
  if (shouldOverride) {
    // Clear existing transcript courses (with 'transferred_' prefix)
    // Add new courses
  }
  // Save to localStorage immediately
};

// Auto-transfer courses when transcript data is available
useEffect(() => {
  if (transcriptData) {
    const allTranscriptCourses = getAllTranscriptCourses();
    if (allTranscriptCourses.length > 0) {
      transferCoursesToPlanner(allTranscriptCourses, false); // Don't override on initial load
    }
  }
}, [transcriptData]);
```

### Persistence Strategy
- **Transcript Data**: Saved to `localStorage` as `transcriptData`
- **Academic Plan**: Saved to `localStorage` as `academicPlan`
- **Semesters**: Saved to `localStorage` as `academicPlanSemesters`

### Course Override Logic
1. When uploading a new transcript:
   - Clear all courses with `transferred_` ID prefix (previously imported from transcript)
   - Keep manually added courses (without `transferred_` prefix)
   - Add all courses from new transcript with `transferred_` prefix
   - Save immediately to localStorage

2. On app initialization:
   - Load transcript data from localStorage
   - Auto-transfer courses if transcript exists (merge mode, no override)
   - Load existing academic plan from localStorage

## User Workflow

### New User Flow
1. User uploads transcript → Courses automatically added to planner
2. User navigates away and returns → Transcript data and courses persist
3. User can manually add additional courses → These are preserved separately

### Existing User Flow (Update Transcript)
1. User clicks "Update Transcript" → Upload new transcript
2. System clears old transcript courses → Preserves manually added courses
3. System adds new transcript courses → All data persists across sessions

## Testing Recommendations

To test the improvements:

1. **Upload a transcript** and verify courses appear in academic planner
2. **Navigate to another page** (e.g., Dashboard) and back to Academic Planner
3. **Verify courses persist** and student name shows in header
4. **Add a manual course** to the planner
5. **Upload a different transcript** and verify:
   - Old transcript courses are replaced
   - Manually added courses remain
   - New transcript courses appear
6. **Refresh the page** and verify all data persists

## Benefits

✅ **Session Persistence**: Transcript data and courses persist across browser sessions
✅ **Smart Override**: New transcripts replace old transcript courses but preserve manual additions  
✅ **Immediate Feedback**: Clear indication when transcript is loaded and being used
✅ **Data Integrity**: All course modifications automatically save to prevent data loss
✅ **User Experience**: Seamless workflow for both new users and transcript updates

The implementation ensures that users never have to re-parse their transcript when switching between pages, while still allowing them to update their transcript and have the changes intelligently merged with their existing academic plan.
