# Enhanced BoilerAI Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented comprehensive enhancements to BoilerAI, transforming it into a personalized undergraduate academic advisor for Purdue University with dynamic AI persona, session management, and context-aware responses.

## ‚úÖ Completed Enhancements

### 1. User Profile System with Academic Information

**Backend Implementation:**
- Enhanced `User` model with academic profile fields:
  - `major` (Computer Science, Data Science, Artificial Intelligence)
  - `currentYear` (Freshman, Sophomore, Junior, Senior)
  - `expectedGraduationYear` (2024-2030)
  - `interests` (array of academic interests)
  - `academicGoals` (array of academic goals)
  - `profileCompleted` (boolean flag)

**API Endpoints:**
- `PUT /api/auth/profile` - Update academic profile
- `GET /api/auth/profile` - Retrieve user profile
- `POST /api/auth/session` - Update session tracking

### 2. Enhanced AI Response Generation with Dynamic Persona

**Key Features:**
- **Dynamic System Prompt**: Builds personalized context using user profile data
- **Context-Aware Responses**: References student's major, year, and graduation timeline
- **Warm Professional Tone**: Conversational yet authoritative academic advisor persona
- **No Hardcoded Greetings**: Dynamic responses based on user context

**Implementation Location:** `/backend/src/routes/advisor.js`

### 3. Undergraduate-Only Scope Enforcement

**Features:**
- **Automatic Graduate Query Detection**: Detects grad school, PhD, masters keywords
- **Immediate Redirection**: Provides specific redirect message for graduate queries
- **Purdue Graduate School Reference**: Directs users to proper graduate resources

**Test Results:** ‚úÖ Working perfectly - automatically redirects graduate queries

### 4. Session Management for Upload Prompts

**Features:**
- **Unique Session IDs**: Generated per app session
- **One-Time Transcript Prompts**: Only prompts once per session
- **Session Tracking**: Updates session count and activity
- **Smart Prompting**: Suggests transcript upload for more personalized advice

### 5. Transcript Upload and Parsing Integration

**Features:**
- **Secure Upload Processing**: Ephemeral processing with FERPA compliance
- **Multiple Format Support**: PDF, DOCX, and text formats
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Uses transcript data for tailored advice

### 6. Frontend Context Integration

**Enhanced AuthContext:**
- Added `sessionId` generation and tracking
- New `updateAcademicProfile()` method
- Session-aware profile management
- Automatic session tracking on login

## üéØ Test Results

Our comprehensive test suite shows excellent progress:

```
‚úÖ login: PASSED - Authentication working correctly
‚úÖ sessionTracking: PASSED - Session management functional  
‚úÖ graduateScope: PASSED - Undergraduate-only enforcement working
‚úÖ profileRetrieval: PASSED - Profile data retrieval working
```

**Graduate Scope Test Result:**
```
Response: "I'm focused on undergraduate advising, so I can't assist with grad school applications. You can find great resources on Purdue's Graduate School website or contact their admissions team directly. Need help with undergraduate prep, like boosting your GPA?"
```
