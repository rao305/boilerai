# Computer Science Core (Freshman/Sophomore)

## Overview
The CS core builds foundations in programming, discrete math, hardware, data structures, and systems. Students typically finish the six-course core across the first four semesters (plus CS 19300 Tools).

- **Courses:** [CS 18000](./course_pages/CS18000.md), [CS 18200](./course_pages/CS18200.md), [CS 24000](./course_pages/CS24000.md), [CS 25000](./course_pages/CS25000.md), [CS 25100](./course_pages/CS25100.md), [CS 25200](./course_pages/CS25200.md)  
- **Seminar:** [CS 19300](./course_pages/CS19300.md) (1 cr, first semester)

## Track Declaration
Students **must declare a track by the term they take CS 25200** (Systems Programming). The two supported tracks are:
- [Machine Intelligence (MI)](./track_mi.md)
- [Software Engineering (SE)](./track_se.md)

## Grade & Counting Policy
- All major required courses, track requirements, and track selectives (and their prerequisites) must be completed with **grade C or better** to count toward the degree.
- No double-counting across requirement buckets.
