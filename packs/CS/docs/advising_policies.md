# Advising Policies (CS)

## Global Course Policy
- **Minimum grade:** A course only **counts** toward CS degree/track requirements if the earned grade is **C or better**. (Prereq gates may list Câ€“; counting rules remain C or higher.)
- **No double counting:** A single course cannot satisfy multiple buckets simultaneously.
- **Offerings & load:** Respect term offerings and max credits per term (default cap: 18; overload requires approval).
- **Track declaration:** Must declare a track by the term containing **CS 25200**.

## Substitutions / Notes
- **SE Capstone substitution:** [EPCS 41100](./course_pages/EPCS41100.md) + [EPCS 41200](./course_pages/EPCS41200.md) may substitute for **CS 40700** with track-chair approval.
- **Pair rule:** In SE, **CS 31100 + CS 41100** together satisfy **one** elective.
- **Graduate courses:** SE electives include graduate options (e.g., CS 51000, CS 59000-SRS) where allowed by standing/restrictions.

## Transcript & Evaluation
- Transfer/ap credit is recognized when mapped to an existing course ID or approved equivalency.
- Repeats: the highest eligible grade counts for requirement satisfaction.
