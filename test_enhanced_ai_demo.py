1. Prioritize Machine Intelligence Track Courses:
‚Ä¢ Ensure you are taking the required courses for the Machine Intelligence track. Consult the Purdue CS degree requirements and the Machine Intelligence track requirements to plan your schedule effectively.

2. Consider Overloading:
‚Ä¢ You can consider taking more courses during a semester, such as 18 credit hours, to progress faster. Be mindful of your workload and ensure you can maintain good grades.

3. Summer Classes:
‚Ä¢ Take advantage of summer courses to fulfill degree requirements. Purdue offers a variety of courses during the summer sessions that can help you stay on track or even get ahead.
