# White Screen Issue - Fix Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **Incomplete Function Implementations**
- Fixed `parseTranscriptWithRealGemini()` - Added complete Gemini API integration with fallback
- Fixed `processTranscript()` - Added proper file processing with validation
- Fixed `testTranscriptParsing()` - Added complete mock data implementation

### 2. **Missing Error Handling**
- Added comprehensive try-catch blocks with user-friendly error messages
- Added timeout protection (60s for files, 45s for text)
- Added input validation and file type checking
- Added progress interval cleanup to prevent memory leaks

### 3. **Data Validation Issues**
- Added response validation for transcript data structure
- Added safe data extraction with fallback values
- Added error handling for course transfer operations

### 4. **React Error Boundaries**
- Created `ErrorBoundary` component to catch rendering errors
- Wrapped `DegreeAudit` and `TranscriptUploader` components with error boundaries
- Added user-friendly error messages and recovery options

### 5. **Improved User Experience**
- Added detailed console logging for debugging
- Added informative toast notifications
- Added loading states with proper cleanup
- Added graceful fallbacks when operations fail

## Test Plan

To verify the fix works:

1. **Test File Upload**
   - Upload a PDF transcript file
   - Verify processing completes without white screen
   - Check error handling with invalid files

2. **Test Text Input**
   - Paste transcript text
   - Verify processing completes successfully
   - Test with invalid/short text

3. **Test Error Scenarios**
   - Test with no API key (should show fallback data)
   - Test with network timeout
   - Test with corrupted files

## Key Improvements

- **No more white screens** - All errors are caught and displayed properly
- **Better feedback** - Users see progress and clear error messages
- **Graceful degradation** - System continues working even when parts fail
- **Robust validation** - Input validation prevents many common issues
- **Memory safety** - Proper cleanup of intervals and promises

The application should now handle transcript processing gracefully without causing white screen issues.
